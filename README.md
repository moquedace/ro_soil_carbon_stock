## Global warming may turn ice-free areas of Maritime and Peninsular Antarctica into potential soil organic carbon sinks
Welcome to the repository dedicated to the R programming language source code for the scientific article **Global warming may turn ice-free areas of Maritime and Peninsular Antarctica into potential soil organic carbon sinks**. This repository aims to transparently and accessibly provide the scripts and algorithms used in the analysis and mapping of soil carbon in the Antarctica. This repository establishes a solid foundation for the replication of results and the enhancement of research.


### Objective:
The main goal of this repository is to facilitate the understanding and replication of the conducted study, allowing researchers, students, and interested individuals to access the code and algorithms used to process and analyze geospatial data related to soil carbon in Antarctica. Additionally, it promotes open, transparent, and accessible science in open source (`R language`).



### Repository content:
#### R Scripts:
[Pedotranference soil density and construction of splines.](./pages/pedotransfer_splines.md)<br>
[Model fitting.](./pages/fit_model.md)<br>
[Map prediction.](./pages/pred_map.md)<br>



#### Datasets:
[Data samples used in the study.](./pages/comp_models.md)<br>
[Environmental predictors.](./pages/predictors.md)<br>
[Final dataset for model fitting and result reproduction.](./pages/dataset_ocs.md)<br>

#### Results:
The final maps (mean, quantiles, and coefficient of variation) of both soil organic carbon stock estimates and uncertainties are available for download on Zenodo using the DOI below:<br>
