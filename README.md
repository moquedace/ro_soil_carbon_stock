## High-resolution mapping of soil carbon stocks in the western Amazon
Welcome to the repository dedicated to the R programming language source code for the scientific article **High-resolution mapping of soil carbon stocks in the western Amazon**. This repository aims to transparently and accessibly provide the scripts and algorithms used in the analysis and mapping of soil carbon in the state of Rondônia, Brazil. This repository establishes a solid foundation for the replication of results and the enhancement of research.


### Objective:
The main goal of this repository is to facilitate the understanding and replication of the conducted study, allowing researchers, students, and interested individuals to access the code and algorithms used to process and analyze geospatial data related to soil carbon in Rondônia. Additionally, it promotes open, transparent, and accessible science in open source (`R language`).
